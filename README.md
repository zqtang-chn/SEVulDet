# SEVulDet: A Semantics-Enhanced Based Learnable Vulnerability Detector for Arbitrary Length Codes
Using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect software vulnerability attracts the majority of attention from researchers. However, due to the fixed input length and imperfect code slicing method in RNN, lots of semantic information has been lost. In this paper, we present SEVulDet, a deep learning based code vulnerability detection scheme that adopts Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a multilayer attention mechanism and a semantics-enhanced code slicing approach to retrieve the lost semantic information and detect more vulnerabilities in C/C++. We make the first attempt to combine CNN and attention mechanisms in the vulnerability detection area. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our SEVulDet by increasing F1 scores by 5.4% for multiple types of vulnerabilities and by 7.9% on average for single types of vulnerabilities compared with existing RNN-based methods.
