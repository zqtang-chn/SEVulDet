# Prototype System
The main goal of our work is to provide a more efficient deep learning based vulnerability detector, by removing the restriction of the input length and designing a multilayer attention mechanism for CNN to collect global semantic information which is important for vulnerability detection.

We are in the process of developing our work on vulnerability detection into a prototype system and depositing it on the Internet, so stay tuned.
